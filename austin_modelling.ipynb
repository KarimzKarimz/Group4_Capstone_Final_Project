    "# Investment Type Recommender System\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "Many Kenyans, especially young adults and first-time investors, struggle to identify investment avenues that align with their financial goals, risk appetite, and income level. The lack of personalized financial guidance often leads to poor or delayed investment decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges\n",
    "- **Low financial literacy and accessibility to advisory services**  \n",
    "  Many potential investors lack foundational knowledge or support systems to understand available investment options or evaluate their suitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Overwhelming investment options**  \n",
    "  The abundance of options—such as SACCOs, stocks, real estate, government bonds, and money market funds—can be confusing and lead to decision fatigue.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **One-size-fits-all investment marketing**  \n",
    "  Most financial institutions promote products generically, failing to account for individual goals, income, and risk profiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lack of data-driven tools for personalized investment planning**  \n",
    "  There is limited availability of intelligent systems to assist users in navigating investments based on their unique profiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Distrust and fear of loss**  \n",
    "  Without adequate knowledge or guidance, potential investors may fear financial loss or fall victim to scams, leading to investment hesitation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proposed Solution\n",
    "A **machine learning-based recommender system** that suggests ideal investment types based on a user's financial profile, risk tolerance, and goals. This system can help both fintech platforms and financial institutions deliver personalized advisory services at scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Brief Conclusion\n",
    "By guiding users toward the most suitable investment types, this solution aims to enhance financial inclusion and support smarter, confidence-driven investment decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "Many individuals, especially in emerging markets, face significant challenges in making informed investment decisions due to limited financial literacy and lack of personalized advisory services. The wide range of available investment options—SACCOs, stocks, real estate, government bonds, and money market funds—can be overwhelming without guidance. Additionally, the generic approach in investment marketing overlooks the diverse financial goals, income levels, and risk appetites of potential investors, leading to poor financial outcomes and disengagement from long-term wealth-building.\n",
